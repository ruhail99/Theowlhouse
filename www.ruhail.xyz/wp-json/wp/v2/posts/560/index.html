However, she thinks that as the Owl House itself, Hooty has a duty to care for its residents, which is a worthy purpose. Lilith&#8217;s words inspired Hooty and he decided to live up to it by going to help Luz, Eda, and King. He discovers that King&#8217;s voice is cracking and jokes that King is going through puberty, causing King to leave the room in frustration. Hooty tries to bond with Eda over King growing up, only to discover that she is tirelessly preparing herself for whatever Emperor Belos is planning next. Hooty points out that whenever Eda stresses like this, it triggers the curse, but Eda leaves the room, blasting an air horn to stay awake. Luz then asks everyone to keep it down as they are scaring the echo mouse. She then tries to voice her concerns about not getting home, but ends up voicing her concerns about Amity instead, prompting her to run away out of embarrassment.
